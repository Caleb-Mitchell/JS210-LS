/*

Problem: Write a program to determine a studentâ€™s grade based on the average of
three scores you get from the user.

input: none
output:
- a prompt asking for input from user (3 integers as strings)
- a statement of the students average letter grade

rules:
- If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then the grade is 'A'
- If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 90 then the
grade is 'B'
- If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 70 then the
grade is 'C'
- If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'

mm:
ask user for input, 3 times
find average
find and display letter grade based on average
