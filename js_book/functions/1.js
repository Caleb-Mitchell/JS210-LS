/*

this code logs `1` to the console. Executing the `foo` function does not affect
the output, as within the function declaration for `foo` we are declaring a new
local variable called `bar`, within the inner scope of the `foo` function, and
assigning it to the Number `2`. This does not mututate the value referenced by
the local variable `bar` declared on line 1.
